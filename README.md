## Instructions:


1. Under **Clone or download**, click Download ZIP.
2. Save the contents of the ZIP file to the **htdocs** folder in your MAMP/WAMP application folder.
3. Open your MAMP/WAMP server.
4. Navigate to local host page (http://localhost:8888).
5. From there navigate to the **database/** folder and click on **dbSetup.php**.
6. This should create a new database called dating_website and a new table in the database called users (unless something has gone wrong, the username and password used for the db connection in setup.php may need to be changed).
7. Now navigate back out of the database folder and into the pages folder and click on **register.php** (or just click on the link that appears).
9. Play around with the functionality.
10. To look at the database go into phpMyAdmin from the MAMP/WAMP homepage (or http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin/?lang=en).
11. Or, if you have switched the connection to the HIVE server use this link to view DB (http://hive.csis.ul.ie/phpmyadmin/)

### Notes:
- I'm using Visual Studio Code to do all my coding. It has loads of extensions which make writing html, css, etc. much handier.
- If you download it all you need to do is open the **htdocs** folder from the menu and you can work from there.
- We can talk about weather we want to use Github to combine and keep track of changes and all that.
